# Crowdfunding_ETL  
In this Extract, Transform, and Load mini project, we built an ETL pileline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or REGEX to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, 4 CSV files were created; these CSV files were used to create an ERD (via QuickDBD), a table schema, and imported into a Postgres database.  

## Data Extraction, Transformation, and Export
* Use 'crowdfunding.xlsx' and 'contacts.xslx' to create the following DataFrames (all of which were exported into 4 CSV files):  
    * contacts_df,  
    * category_df,  
    * subcategory_df,  
    * campaign_cleaned.  
    
## Crowdfunding Databse Creation  
* Design an ERD from the CSV files using QuickDBD.
* Create a PostgreSQL schema from the ERD and load the CSV files into the corresponding tables.
